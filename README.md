# Project NeuroComputation: 2023
## Introduction
This is a team project involving the implementation of Adaline,<br>
Back Propagation, and Transfer Learning algorithms for classification problems. <br>
There are three deadlines, and each team member is required to contribute to all parts of the submission. We are not allowed to share code between groups, <br>
but we can consult with other groups to seek help on difficulties.

## Part I: Data Generation
For Part I, each team member is required to submit ten data points for "lamed," "bet," and "mem" handwriting, <br>
resulting in 30 data points per team member. We generate the data by writing over a 10 x 10 matrix by hand and then <br>
record the letters as +1 for an entry that has a part of the letter and -1 for the others. <br>
We add another 10 letters by rotating the traced ones by 15 degrees and -15 degrees. <br>
Each team member should submit their data individually to the package on the moodle by the deadline.<br>

## Part II: Adaline Classifications
In Part II, we build a classifier using the Adaline algorithm to classify "mem" from "bet" and "lamed" from "bet". <br>
Each team member will work in teams of two or three. <br>
We encode a classifier that is trained on 80% of the data and tested on the remaining 20%, <br>
doing this five times so that all the data is used for training and testing. <br>
We report all the results and include the number of iterations the code had to run before converging. <br>
In the full report, we will include our names and our I.D's, the code we wrote, <br>
and the results for each choice of training and testing data and the average of all the results.<br>

## Part III: Back Propagation
For Part III, we replace Adaline with a feedforward neural network that we write ourselves or use a package. <br>
We repeat the classifications from earlier parts and report the results. We explain how we decided on the number of neurons and levels.<br>

## Deadlines
Part I: Due Monday, April 24 by 23:59 midnight. (10 points)<br>
Part II: Due May 9 by midnight. Late submission - 10 points until May 16 midnight. After May 23 -20 points.<br>
Part III: Due May 23 midnight. -10 points until May 30; -20 points after that.<br>

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project required us to generate handwritten data for three Hebrew letters and use it to classify them using Adaline and feedforward neural networks.<br>
We followed the guidelines provided by Professor Manevitz and submitted our work on time to meet the three deadlines.
Through this project, we gained valuable experience in generating data, implementing Adaline and neural network algorithms, and interpreting the results.<br>
We also learned the importance of collaboration and communication with our team members to ensure that everyone is on the same page and understands all parts of the project.
Overall, this project challenged us to think critically and creatively, and we are proud of the work we have accomplished. <br>
We look forward to applying the skills we learned in future projects and continuing to improve our understanding of machine learning algorithms.
